# Saak Transform 

Reimplementation of the paper **On Data-Driven Saak Transform** (https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04176).

This repo is much of my work at the MCL at USC. I use this framework I have
built to test theories about how to use the Saak transform for classification
and visualizing the Saak coefficients. 

The code is very messy as it is often just quick experiments. For a more
detailed a clean implementation of the Saak transform go to https://github.com/davidsonic/Saak-Transform.
